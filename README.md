# Fetch - iOS Coding Challenge

## Overview
This is a native iOS application that allows users to browse dessert recipes using TheMealDB API. The app fetches a list of meals in the dessert category and displays them sorted alphabetically. When a user selects a meal, they are navigated to a detail view that shows the meal name, instructions, and ingredients with their measurements.

## Features
- Fetches a list of dessert meals from TheMealDB API.
- Displays the list of meals sorted alphabetically.
- Navigates to a detail view with meal name, instructions, and ingredients when a meal is selected.
- Filters out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them.
- Uses SwiftUI for the user interface.
